# 1. Environment Variables in Next.js:
#   - Variables with NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix are available in both client and server code
#   - Variables without NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix are ONLY available in server-side code
#   - NEVER put sensitive keys in NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables
#
# 2. To use this file:
#   - Copy this file to .env.local

#   - Set these variables in your deployment environment (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
#   - Do not commit .env.local to your repository
