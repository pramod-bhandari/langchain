# Idea 1: Langchain-Powered Q&A System with Data Input and Document Support

## Overview

This system leverages **Langchain** to enable users to input data, ask questions, and receive intelligent answers. Initially, users can feed data directly and ask questions about it. In the future, users will also be able to upload document files (such as PDFs) and ask questions related to the content of those files. The system does not require user login at this stage.

## Key Features

- **User Data Input:**  
  Users can feed data into the system, which is stored and made available for question answering.

- **Langchain Q&A:**  
  Users can ask questions about the data. The system uses Langchain to process the question, retrieve relevant information, and generate an answer.

- **No Login Required:**  
  The system is open for use without any authentication or login process at present.

- **Search Functionality:**  
  Users can search their previous questions and answers.

- **Chat History:**  
  The system remembers previous conversations, allowing users to refer back to past interactions.

- **Future Feature â€“ Document Upload:**  
  Users will be able to upload document files (e.g., PDFs). The system will extract content from these files, enabling users to ask questions about the uploaded documents.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Feed Data to System:**  
   Users can input or paste data directly into the system. This data is stored and indexed for question answering.

2. **Ask Questions:**  
   Users can ask questions related to the data they have provided. Langchain processes the question, retrieves relevant information, and generates an answer.

3. **Show Answer to User:**  
   The answer is displayed to the user in the interface.

4. **Search Previous Q&A:**  
   Users can search through their previous questions and answers for easy reference.

5. **System Remembers Chat History:**  
   The system maintains a history of all user interactions, allowing for continuity and reference in future sessions.

6. **Future: Upload Document (PDF):**  
   Users will be able to upload document files (such as PDFs). The system will extract and index the content, enabling users to ask questions about the uploaded documents using Langchain.
