## Agentic Features

### 1. Autonomous Query Planning
- Break down complex queries into logical steps
- Parse multiple sections separately before synthesizing
- Handle queries requiring multi-step reasoning
- Example: "Tell me about payment terms and dispute resolution in this contract"

### 2. Active Exploration & Follow-up Suggestions
- Proactively suggest related insights after answering
- Identify connected topics in the document
- Examples:
  - "Would you like to know about penalty clauses mentioned in this section?"
  - "I noticed recurring clauses about indemnityâ€”interested?"

### 3. Agent Memory & Knowledge Base
- Store previous queries and PDF metadata
- Build persistent knowledge about documents
- Support:
  - Short-term memory: Session-level cache
  - Long-term memory: Stored embeddings & conversation history

### 4. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Deploy specialized sub-agents:
  - Summarizer Agent: Creates coherent multi-page summaries
  - Extractor Agent: Pulls specific structured information (dates, names, tables)
- Coordinate workflow between agents
- Implement using frameworks like LangGraph

### 5. Multimodal Capabilities
- OCR and image analysis:
  - Extract text from scanned documents
  - Analyze charts/tables inside PDFs
  - Summarize embedded images or diagrams
- Implement using:
  - OCR tools: Tesseract or EasyOCR
  - Vision models: GPT-4V or similar

## Technical Implementation Considerations
- Vector database for embeddings storage
- Document chunking strategies
- Prompt engineering for different agent roles
- Memory management and persistence
- Security and data privacy 
- Caching architecture for document processing
- Bias detection algorithms and fairness metrics
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Agent Architecture and Implementation Approach

We will use a combination of LangChain and LangGraph for implementing the agent system, with multi-agent workflows to handle complex tasks. Here's the proposed architecture:

### 1. Framework Selection
- **Primary Framework**: LangChain for core components and utilities
- **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph for complex multi-agent workflows and state management
- **Vector Database**: Chroma or Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval

### 2. Agent Structure
- **Controller Agent**: Orchestrates the workflow and delegates to specialized agents
- **Specialized Agents**:
  - Document Processor Agent: Handles parsing, chunking, and embedding
  - Search Agent: Manages retrieval and ranking of document chunks
  - Response Generator Agent: Synthesizes answers from retrieved context
  - Summarization Agent: Creates document and section summaries
  - Analytics Agent: Performs sentiment analysis and topic modeling
  - Multimodal Agent: Processes images, charts, and non-text content

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflow
- Implement with LangGraph for complex task routing
- Use state machines to manage conversation flow
- Enable parallel processing where appropriate (e.g., processing multiple documents)
- Implement fallback mechanisms for handling errors

### 4. Memory and Knowledge Management
- Hybrid memory system:
  - Buffer memory for immediate context
  - Vector store for long-term semantic knowledge
  - Key-value store for metadata and user preferences
- Cross-agent memory sharing via centralized knowledge base

### 5. Tool Integration
- Use LangChain's tool abstraction for agent capabilities
- Tools include:
  - Document loaders for various file formats
  - OCR and image processing tools
  - Vector store operations
  - Web search for augmentation
  - External APIs for specialized processing

### 6. Evaluation and Monitoring
- Implement feedback loops for agent improvement
- Use LangSmith for tracing and debugging agent workflows
- Deploy evaluation harnesses for measuring answer quality and bias

### 7. Deployment Architecture
- Modular components for scalability
- Asynchronous processing for handling multiple user requests
- Containerized deployment for easy scaling
- Caching layer for performance optimization

This architecture leverages LangChain's components and LangGraph's workflow capabilities to create a flexible, powerful document processing system with multiple specialized agents working together through clearly defined workflows.
